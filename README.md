## What's a cutscene?

Cutscenes are a non-interactive sequence in videogames. In many cases, it’s used to explain the story of the game, but it have many uses.

We can difference cutscenes in different types:

### Pre rendered cutscenes
These cutscenes are animated and rendered independent from the game. There are videos played in the game.  Here is an example

Advantages: Higher quality

Disadvantages: Is too heavy and need to be charged, often with a charge screen. That's negative for the player inmersion.

### Real Time cutscenes
These cutscenes are rendered with the game engine and the game graphics. It's also known as machinima.

Advantages: Breaks lees the player inmersion, because graphics don't change his quality. Also are fastest to charge and things like player weapons, armors etc adquired in the game can be showed in the cutscene.

Disadvantages: Lower quality, but nowadays the game engines are enough powerful to don't have so much difference with pre rendered cutscenes

### Interactive cutscenes

In this cutscenes, the player take the control of the character and do sequences of buttons that appears on the screen. This is also known as quick time event.

Advantages: These cutscenes don't stop gameplay, the player have to do things.

Disadvantages: Players are less focused in what the cutscene is explaining.
